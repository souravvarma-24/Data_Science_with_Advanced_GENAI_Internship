## 🚀 Task 2 - Diminos Case Study

*Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship*

This repository contains a **business-focused data analysis case study** on pizza delivery times for a Dimino’s franchise store.  
The analysis evaluates whether the store meets Dimino’s operational performance requirement based on delivery efficiency.

The primary objective is to assess **service reliability, risk factors, and percentile-based performance**, rather than building predictive models.

## 🧩 Business Problem

Dimino’s evaluates store performance using the following key metric:

- **95% of all orders must be delivered within 31 minutes**

Failure to meet this benchmark may result in penalties, including potential loss of franchise rights.  
This analysis helps the store owner understand delivery performance and identify operational risks.
