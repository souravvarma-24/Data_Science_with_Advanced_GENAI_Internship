## 🧾 Problem Descriptions

### **1️⃣ Maximum Product of Two Elements — `1_maximum_product.py`**
- Identifies the two largest numbers in the array  
- Computes: **(max1 − 1) × (max2 − 1)**  
- Strengthens sorting & comparison logic  

---

### **2️⃣ Count Number of Teams — `2_count_teams.py`**
- Counts valid teams `(i < j < k)` based on rating patterns  
- Reinforces nested comparisons & dynamic counting  
- Useful for combinatorial reasoning  

---

### **3️⃣ Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time — `3_homework_students.py`**
- Determines how many students were active during `queryTime`  
- Enhances range checking and interval-based reasoning  

---

### **4️⃣ Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero — `4_steps_reduce_zero.py`**
- Reduces a number using rules:  
  - Even → divide by 2  
  - Odd → subtract 1  
- Builds iterative reduction & bitwise insight  

---

### **5️⃣ Counting Bits — `5_counting_bits.py`**
- Returns array containing the count of `1` bits for numbers `0` to `n`  
- Demonstrates dynamic programming & bit decomposition  

---
