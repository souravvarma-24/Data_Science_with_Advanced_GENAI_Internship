## 🚀 Flask - Task 1

*Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship*

This repository contains a basic Flask web application developed to demonstrate the use of URL query parameters and request handling in Flask. The application accepts a user name through the URL, converts it into UPPER CASE, and displays the processed output directly on the browser.

The objective of this task is to understand Flask routing, query parameter extraction, and simple backend logic implementation without focusing on UI design or advanced frontend components.

## 📁 Project Structure

All project files are organized in a clean and minimal structure as shown below:

```
📁 Sourav_419_Data-Science-with-Advanced-GENAI-Internship_Assignment_7
│
├── app.py
└── README.md
```

Each file plays a specific role in demonstrating the working of the Flask application.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Create a Flask Application that takes the user name in the query parameter from the URL and converts it to UPPER CASE and displays it on the browser. This task evaluates the understanding of Flask basics, request processing, and response handling.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

Python and Flask are used to develop this application.

---

## ▶️ How the Application Works

The Flask application runs on a local development server. The user provides a name using a URL query parameter. Flask retrieves this value using the request object, processes the input by converting it into uppercase using Python string methods, and returns the result as a browser response.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Application

First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. Install Flask by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:  
pip install flask  

After installing Flask, navigate to the project directory and start the application using:  
python app.py  

Once the server starts, open a web browser and use the following URL format:  
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?name=yourname  

---

## 📌 Example

If the input URL is:  
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?name=sourav  

The output displayed on the browser will be:  
SOURAV
