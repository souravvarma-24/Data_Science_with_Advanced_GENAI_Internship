## 🚀 Task 1 - Analysis on ML Test Scores

**Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship**

This repository contains an **exploratory data analysis case study** on machine learning test scores across three student batches, focusing on **performance comparison and insight generation** using descriptive statistics and visualization.

The objective is to understand **patterns, consistency, and variability** in scores rather than building predictive models.
