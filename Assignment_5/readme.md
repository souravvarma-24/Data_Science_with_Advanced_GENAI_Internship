# Analysis of ML Test Scores Across Batches

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes machine learning test scores of students belonging to three different batches.  
The objective is to understand and compare the performance of each batch using descriptive statistics and visual analysis, and to derive meaningful insights from the data.

This is an open-ended analysis task focused on insight generation rather than model building.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Batch**: Name of the batch
- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each student
- **Score**: Test score obtained (out of 7)

Each row represents the performance of a single student.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
The analysis includes:

- Understanding the overall score distribution
- Batch-wise comparison of average scores
- Analysis of score variability and consistency across batches
- Visual exploration to support observations
- Identification of relative strengths and weaknesses among batches

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Noticeable differences were observed in average performance across batches
- Some batches showed more consistent scores, while others had higher variability
- Score distributions helped in understanding overall batch-level performance trends

(Detailed observations and explanations are provided within the notebook.)

## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear comparison of student performance across three different batches.  
The insights derived can help instructors and stakeholders understand performance patterns and identify areas for academic improvement.
